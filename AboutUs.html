          <h1>The Atlantics</h1>

          <p>We are a duo, of two wild guys, we really like video games, which is why we 
            decided to create this channel. We would love to bring video game videos, to 
            transport our fans on a crazy adventure. Someday we'd also like to bring 
            reactions, vlogs, and much more.</p>

            <P>Lorenzo immediately wanted to become a YouTuber, since he was 6 years old, 
                but I could not publish them, because he was too young, after 8 years he met 
                Alessandro, a school friend of his. During a Computer science lesson, Alessandro 
                came up against him and asked him, "What do you think if we create a site about gameplay", 
                and he accepted immediately because the gameplay is one of their favorite things. Days later 
                Lorenzo came up with the idea of ​​creating the YouTube channel.</P>

      <p>Minecraft is one of the most played games in the world, it has more than 
        140 million active users per month, and this is not the most impressive figure.</p>

        <p>Minecraft is an open-world sandbox video game developed by Mojang Studios and originally 
          created by Swedish programmer Markus Persson, aka Notch, using the Java programming language. 
          It was first released on May 17, 2009, and the full game was released on November 18, 2011, on PC. 
          Minecraft was then released on many other platforms and, with 200 million copies sold, it is the most 
          purchased video game ever.</p>

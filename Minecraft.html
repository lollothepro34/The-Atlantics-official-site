      <h3>Minecraft</h3>

      <p>Minecraft is one of the most played games in the world, it has more than 
        140 million active users per month, and this is not the most impressive figure.</p>

        <p>Minecraft is an open-world sandbox video game developed by Mojang Studios and originally 
          created by Swedish programmer Markus Persson, aka Notch, using the Java programming language. 
          It was first released on May 17, 2009, and the full game was released on November 18, 2011, on PC. 
          Minecraft was then released on many other platforms and, with 200 million copies sold, it is the most 
          purchased video game ever.</p>

          <p>In Minecraft, players can freely explore a procedural 3D world made up of blocks, 
            search for ore, craft various tools and objects, and build structures. Depending
            on the game mode, it is possible to fight CPU-controlled entities, but also to 
            cooperate or fight against other real players. The main game modes are Survival, 
            where players must find resources and avoid dying, and Creative, where you have access 
            to infinite resources and the ability to fly.</p>

            <p>Minecraft has been positively judged by critics: it has won numerous 
              awards and has been described as one of the most influential games of the 2010 decade. 
              Social media, parodies, and MineCon have played an important role in the fame of the 
              game. It has also been used in the education sector, especially in computer science (since it is 
              possible to create virtual computers within the game). In 2014, Mojang was bought by Microsoft 
              for $ 2.5 billion. Numerous spin-offs have been drawn from Minecraft, such as Minecraft: Story Mode, 
              Minecraft: Dungeons, Minecraft Earth, and Minecraft Education Edition, projects later canceled due to lack 
              of funds.</p>


              <h2>Game modes</h2>

              <p>Survival mode</p>

              <p>The player attempting to make a stone axe by placing the required materials into the crafting grid, a 3x3 block of 
                item spaces hovering over the standard inventory, which is filled with other items.

                as some other blocks and items in the player's inventory.
                In survival mode, players have to gather natural resources such as 
                wood and stone found in the environment in order to craft certain blocks 
                and items. Depending on the difficulty, monsters spawn in darker areas outside a 
                certain radius of the character, requiring players to build a shelter at night. The mode also has a 
                health bar which is depleted by attacks from mobs, falls, drowning, falling into lava, suffocation, 
                starvation, and other events. Players also have a hunger bar, which must be periodically refilled by eating food 
                in-game, except in peaceful difficulty. If the hunger bar is depleted, automatic healing will stop and eventually 
                health will deplete. Health replenishes when players have a nearly full hunger bar or continuously on peaceful 
                difficulty.</p>

                <img src="game modes.jpg" alt="">

                <p>Players can craft a wide variety of items in Minecraft. Craftable items include armor, which 
                  mitigates damage from attacks; weapons (such as swords or axes), which allows monsters and 
                  animals to be killed more easily; and tools, which break certain types of blocks more quickly. 
                  Some items have multiple tiers depending on the material used to craft them, with higher-tier 
                  items being more effective and durable. Players can construct furnaces, which can cook food, 
                  process ores, and convert materials into other materials. Players may also exchange goods with a 
                  villager (NPC) through a trading system, which involves trading emeralds for different goods and vice versa.</p>


                <h2>Hardcore mode</h2>

                <p>Hardcore mode is a survival mode variant that is locked to the hardest 
                  setting and has permadeath. If a player dies in a hardcore world, they 
                  are no longer allowed to interact with it, so they can either be put into spectator 
                  mode and explore the world or delete it entirely.[52] This game mode can only be accessed 
                  within the Java Edition.</p>

                  <h2>Creative mode</h2>

                  <p>In creative mode, players have access to nearly all resources and items 
                    in the game through the inventory menu, and can place or remove them instantly. 
                    Players can toggle the ability to fly freely around the game world at will, and their 
                    characters do not take any damage and are not affected by hunger. The game mode helps players 
                    focus on building and creating projects of any size without disturbance.</p>

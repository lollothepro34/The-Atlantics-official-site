      <h3>Minecraft</h3>

      <p>Minecraft is one of the most played games in the world, it has more than 
        140 million active users per month, and this is not the most impressive figure.</p>

        <p>Minecraft is an open-world sandbox video game developed by Mojang Studios and originally 
          created by Swedish programmer Markus Persson, aka Notch, using the Java programming language. 
          It was first released on May 17, 2009, and the full game was released on November 18, 2011, on PC. 
          Minecraft was then released on many other platforms and, with 200 million copies sold, it is the most 
          purchased video game ever.</p>

          <p>In Minecraft, players can freely explore a procedural 3D world made up of blocks, 
            search for ore, craft various tools and objects, and build structures. Depending
            on the game mode, it is possible to fight CPU-controlled entities, but also to 
            cooperate or fight against other real players. The main game modes are Survival, 
            where players must find resources and avoid dying, and Creative, where you have access 
            to infinite resources and the ability to fly.</p>

            <p>Minecraft has been positively judged by critics: it has won numerous 
              awards and has been described as one of the most influential games of the 2010 decade. 
              Social media, parodies, and MineCon have played an important role in the fame of the 
              game. It has also been used in the education sector, especially in computer science (since it is 
              possible to create virtual computers within the game). In 2014, Mojang was bought by Microsoft 
              for $ 2.5 billion. Numerous spin-offs have been drawn from Minecraft, such as Minecraft: Story Mode, 
              Minecraft: Dungeons, Minecraft Earth, and Minecraft Education Edition, projects later canceled due to lack 
              of funds.</p>

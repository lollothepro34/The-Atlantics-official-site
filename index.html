   <h1>First you need to learn what haker do and what type of problems you might take doing this job.</h1>


     <h1>1. Significance of hacker</h1>
     <p>Noun
      In computer science, very experienced
      operator in particular sectors of the
      subject; also as adj. (invar.). "culture h.”</p>

      <p>Hacker is an English language term that
        designates a person who uses their computer
        skills to explore the ins and outs of
        programmable systems and experiment with how
        to extend their use.</p>

        <p>The word derives from the verb "To hack" no
          longer indicated the activity of soldering
          circuits with strange appearances, but that
          of composing various programs together, with
          little respect for those methods or
          procedures used in writing "official"
          software. It also meant improving the
          efficiency and speed of existing software
          that tended to overwhelm the machine's
          resources. And it is here that a different
          root of the term hacker is subsequently
          placed, the substantive form of the English
          verb "to hack" which means "to cut",
          "prune", "shred", "reduce", "open a
          passage", precisely between the lines of
          code that instruct software programs</p>

     <h1>2. Binary Code</h1>

     <p>The binary number system is a base 2
      positional number system. It uses only two
      symbols, usually denoted by 0 and 1,
      instead of the ten digits used by the
      decimal number system.</p>

      <p>Something like:</p>

          visiting an untrustworthy website or
          clicking a suspicious link in a phishing
          email, which can lead to the installation
          of malware. Therefore, protecting the
          security of your computer should be onbyour top priorities. Having an anti-
          malware program can help reduce likelihood of being infected with
          ransomware, viruses, spyware, worms,
          rootkits, keyloggers, trojans, adware,
          potentially unwanted programs, browser
          hijackers, and other malware threats. In addition to preventing malware, anti-
          malware programs are designed to protect
          your privacy, reduce the risk of identity
          theft, and prevent hackers from taking
          over your computer.</p>
